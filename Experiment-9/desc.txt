Person Class Hierarchy Demo

📌 Overview
This project demonstrates the concept of class inheritance in JavaScript using
a simple Person → Student/Teacher hierarchy. It shows how parent classes can be
extended by child classes, and how method overriding works.

🏗 Structure
1. HTML
   - Basic webpage with a heading and <pre> element to display results.

2. JavaScript
   - Person (Base Class)
       Properties: name, age
       Method: displayInfo() → returns name and age.

   - Student (Subclass of Person)
       Additional property: course
       Overrides displayInfo() to include course.

   - Teacher (Subclass of Person)
       Additional property: department
       Overrides displayInfo() to include department.

3. Objects Created
   - student1 → "Shubneet", 19, "Computer Science AIML"
   - teacher1 → "Ms World", 24, "Computer Science AIML"

4. Output
   - Both Student and Teacher details are displayed inside the <pre> tag.

🎯 Key Learning Points
- Inheritance: `extends` keyword lets subclasses reuse parent methods.
- super(): Calls parent constructor or method.
- Method Overriding: Child classes change behavior of parent’s method.
- Template Literals: Backticks ` and ${} allow variable interpolation.

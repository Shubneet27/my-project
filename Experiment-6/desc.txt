I created an Interactive SVG Drawing Tool using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

HTML: Used <svg> to create the drawing area.

CSS: Styled the canvas with borders, background, and layout.

JavaScript:
Used mousedown to start drawing.
Used mousemove to update the shape path dynamically.
Used mouseup to stop drawing.
Created SVG <path> elements using document.createElementNS for real-time drawing.
Managed path coordinates with getAttribute and setAttribute.

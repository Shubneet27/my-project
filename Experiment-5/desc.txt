We built a Dynamic Product Filter web page where users can filter products by category in real time using a dropdown menu.

What we made:
A product list that updates instantly based on the selected category (e.g., Clothing, Electronics, Books) without reloading the page.

How we made it:
HTML was used to structure the page with a dropdown, labels, and product list items.
CSS styled the layout with a clean and simple look similar to the expected output.
JavaScript (DOM Manipulation) handled the filtering logic by listening to dropdown changes and dynamically showing/hiding 
products based on the selected category.
